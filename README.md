# Course-Guidebook
This documunt is mainly notes for myself and others who will be helping me make courses.

Each peice of advice I put together I want to prove true or false to eliminate error and helps make these guidelines a useful reliable source of guidance for teachers and educators to make the best courses in the world. You can find this "proving" inside of the "Book/First Principles" folder.

Each guideline and tip may not be entirely correct, but is simply an estimated guess. As a result many of these guidelines are constantly changing. I hope that by constantly evolving this document it will reach a point of accurracy very fast, as well as some amount of stability. You can find these guidelines inside of the "Guides/Guides" folder.

A personal apology from me (the author) for all the "we" and making it sound like this was written by many people. As well as my tendancy to state everything as a fact, when in fact, they are just an aproximated guess XD.

# Writing style
Crux3D courses are written in a blog-post style, with a few guidelines and restrictions layed out in these documents.

# Repositiory Layout
The folder "The Rant" is mostly me ranting and other non-essential stuff.

The folder "Guides" is the stuff you need to read! It contains rules and guides on how to make / structure courses.

files ending in `.md` are the file containing the text for reading. Click on a "english.md" file to read it.

# Quick links.
This is the living *holy grail* of this document, read it -> [Guides](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Course-Guidebook/blob/main/Guides/Guides/english.md)

Interesting workflow ideas, not complete -> [Teaching Workflow](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Course-Guidebook/blob/main/Guides/Teaching%20Workflow/english.md)

Kinda a copy of the "guides", just more general(?) ^^ -> [Overall methods?](https://github.com/PaperPrototype/Course-Guidebook/blob/main/Guides/Overall/english.md)

# TODO (NOTES TO SELF, FOR THE AUTHOR)
- make separate guidelines for Intro courses and Outro courses
    - currently almost all guidelines are are for Intro courses
    - guidelines for intro and outro courses are mixed

- One document containing first principles.
- Another document containing conclusions built from first principles that can be used for teaching.

Add to guidelines?
- How you find soemthing is mroe interesting than the answer itself (box rotation vs sin roation)
- don't over explain. Over explaining is the result of the intitial explanation failing to get the concept accross.
- take students on journey to solve a problem (story's are easier to remember that individual obejcts. THis is because a story ties everyhting together into one big memory that is easy to access)

branch prediction in one sentence = "the CPU guessing which if statement is correct to gain faster performance"

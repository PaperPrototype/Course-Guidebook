# Nanite-course-Guidelines
A set of guidelines and helpful guides, advice, and guidance for people wanting to teach or make courses.

Each peice of advice I put together I want to prove true or false to eliminate error and helps make these guidelines a useful reliable source of guidance for teachers and educators to make the best courses in the world.

Each guideline and tip may not be entirely correct, but is simply an estimated guess. As a result many of these guidelines are constantly changing. I hope that by constantly evolving this document it will reach a point of accurracy very fast, as well as some amount of stability.

A persoanl apology from me (the author) for all the "we" and making it sound like this was written by many people. As well as my tendancy to stae eveything as a fact, when in fact, they are just a guess.

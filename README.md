# Goal
If we could just download all the information from experts into other peoples minds, suddenly you would have lots of awesome tech being made instead of hordes of beginners trying to "figure it out".

If you find it annoying that people are always struggling and asking you questions about how to do something, if there was a really good course on it then you could just point them to it! And Viola! A whole generation of really well educated devs that are experts! 

My dream, and goal, is to replace college ed with online courses that are way better than the courses you can take in college, and create a whole bunch of really knowledgable and capable engine developers / game devs and as a result have exciting tech being made.

But first we need to get beginners to become experts, experts that can make entire game engines. 

We will do this by forcing every course to have the proper pre-requisites all the way down to "Intro to Coding". This way there are no "gaps" or bridges of knowledge for the students. We will acheive the goal eventually, and we're not giving up. Ever.

These guidelines are a result of trying to achieve this goal by coming up a with a teaching method that will remove the problems current education systems have...
 - bored students
 - students scratching their heads and feeling frsutrating
 - students not knowing why they are learning something
 - most students don't want to do the "excercises", or just don't do them

another goal of these methods is to try to make education addictive.

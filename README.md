# Course-Guidebook
This documunt is mainly notes for myself and others who will be helping me make courses.

Each peice of advice I put together I want to prove true or false to eliminate error and helps make these guidelines a useful reliable source of guidance for teachers and educators to make the best courses in the world.

Each guideline and tip may not be entirely correct, but is simply an estimated guess. As a result many of these guidelines are constantly changing. I hope that by constantly evolving this document it will reach a point of accurracy very fast, as well as some amount of stability.

A persoanl apology from me (the author) for all the "we" and making it sound like this was written by many people. As well as my tendancy to state eveything as a fact, when in fact, they are just an aproximated guess.


# Writing style
Crux3D courses are written in a blog-post style, with a few guidelines and restrictions layed out in these documents.


# Repositiory Layout
The folder "Book" is mostly me ranting and other boring stuff.

The folder "Guides" is the stuff you need to read, it contains rules and guides on how to make / structure courses.

files ending in `.md` are the stuff to read. Click on them to read them.

# TODO
- make separate guidelines for Intro courses and Outro courses
    - currently almost all guidelines are are for Intro courses
    - guidelines for intro and outro courses are mixed

- One document containing first principles.
- Another document containing conclusions built from first principles that can be used for teaching.

Add to guidelines?
- How you find soemthing is mroe interesting than the answer itself (box rotation vs sin roation)
- don't over explain. Over explaining is the result of the intitial explanation failing to get the concept accross.
- take students on journey to solve a problem (story's are easier to remember that individual obejcts. THis is because a story ties everyhting together into one big memory that is easy to access)

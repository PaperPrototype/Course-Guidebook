# Intro
When making your first course you first need somethiing to teach.

Then you will need to have made a working poject of what you will be teaching, and you yourself need to know how it works so that you can explain it well.

# Structuring the project and the layout of the course
Problem:
It is a good idea to remove as many features from the project you will teach as possible to make it simple to teach and simple to learn. Large project will prevent you from being able to focus on teaching the core concepts, and make it hard for the student to prot the code to their own projects. 

One approach is to to make micro projects to illustrate each new concept you are teaching to illiminate what you might call "project specific" code.

Unless a feature will make the project much easier to make or understand then you probably don't need to include it in the main part of the course (not to be confused with features that will make the project easier to *use* as that could result in many features being added).

Solution:
"What if I have this super cool idea that students can do with the tool/project I am teaching?" The students will want a the course you to keep your project as simple as possible focusing on the core conceptws and their implemenetation and how they work. If you want to add cool features or do a cool project using the knowledge the student has learned I recommend you do "Tutorials" after each lecture showing students how they make a cool feature or a cool project.

Why:
Doing this will makes the course shorter and the course only covers the core and important stuff while the "cool features" are optional since a students may not want to make a cool feature.

Also use Tutorials after each lecture instead of excercises. This results in "excercises" being fun and optional, and you can invite the community or students to write their own tutorials for each lecture.

## Where to now?
Now all you have left is to go out and make the course! GitHub is a great place to host written courses but you can use any website or service you want! For the workflow I use you can view the "Teaching Workflow" folder.

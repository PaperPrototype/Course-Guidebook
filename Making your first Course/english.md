# Intro
When making your first course you first need somethiing to teach.

Then you will need to have made a working poject of what you will be teaching, and you yourself need to know how it works so that you can explain it well.

# Structuring the project and the layout of the course
Problem:
It is a good idea to remove as many features from the project you will teach as possible to make it simple to teach and simple to learn. Large project will prevent you from being able to focus on teaching the core concepts, and make it hard for the student to change the code to work with their own projects.

One approach is to to make micro projects to illustrate each new concept you are teaching to illiminate what you might call "project specific" code.

Unless a code feature will make the project much easier to make or understand then you probably don't need to include it in the main part of the course. Instead we recommend making side, optional, tutorials for the course.

Solution:
"What if I have this super cool idea that students can do with the tool/project I am teaching?". Its important to remember that Students may not be interested in that feature, so, keep the course as simple as possible focusing on the core concepts and the implemenetation of them and how they work. 

If you want to add cool features or do a cool project using the knowledge the student has learned I recommend you do "Tutorials" after each lecture showing students how to use the knowledge and add a cool feature or a cool project.

Why:
Doing this will makes the course shorter and make it only covers the core and important stuff while the "cool features" are optional (since not all students may want your "cool" feature).

Also you can use Tutorials after each lecture instead of excercises. This results in "excercises" being fun and optional, and you can invite the community or students to write their own tutorials for each lecture.

## Where to now?
Now all you have left is to go out and make the course! GitHub is a great place to host written courses but you can use any website or service you want! For the workflow I use you can view the "Teaching Workflow" folder.

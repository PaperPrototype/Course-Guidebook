# Intro
This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of guidelines but a reference for those making courses on Nanite3D. This is not really meant to be an evolving guideline, but if a guideline is causing problems or is bad (we'll let you define "bad") then make a pull request to change it or make an Issue.

## OMG_GUIDELINE_001
**INTRODUCING NEW CONCEPTS**
When introducing a new concept don't use any technical jargon or concepts. Instead use plain english and simple words. Be as concise as possible. Don't be vaque give drawings and explain things. Once the student understand it tell them something like
"...mesh format a triangle is made using 3 positions. The correct term for "positions in space" would be, vertices."

## OMG_GUIDELINE_002
**JUST THE FACTS**
No opinions. If you want to show the student why a certain method may be worse then don't say that. Instead show both alternatives and working examples. This way the student see's technology and can see possiblility's, not potholes.

## OMG_GUIDELINE__003
**SHORTER IS BETTER**
When explanaing a concept ask yourself these questions.
 - Will the student be using this information
 - Is this the shortest simplest possible explenation, using pictures, that will get the concept accross so the student can learn
 - Am I babbling? Useless words put people to sleep.
 - Is this sentence hard to read?
 You may rewrite a sentence several times but that is time saved for the student, as well as painful sentence structure that nobody wants to read.

## OMG_GUIDELINE_004
**INFORMATION RULES**
Be as concise and informative as possible while not skipping over stuff. Give informational links in the notes

## OMG_GUIDELINE_005
**LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE CAN TAKE YEARS, SO READ TO "LEARN" EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT IS FASTER**
As stated befoer opinions aren't necessarily useful. This is not true of experience. Experience is **very** useful. Relaying experience is important but

## OMG_GUIDELINE_006
**WRITE NOTES FOR STUDENTS**
Every time you introduce a new concept add it to the notes. Be super concise and short. Notes are mean't for those needing a refresher. Notes should use jargo, as long as its defined in the Vocab section of the notes and was discussed during the lecture.

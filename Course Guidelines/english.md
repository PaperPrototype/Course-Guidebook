# Intro
This is how the big picture for making courses and teaching subjects (this is not for how to teach indiviudal concepts). The goal is to get students to understand something well.

## Informal text
Informal language is easier to understand and follow.

## In context
When teachign a subject teach it in context of its application / use. This makes it more tangible and easier to grasp.

## Teach core 
Teach the core techniques without letting "nice features" get in the way. The student can add the feature themselves to work with the rest of the code in future lectures, and if you think they can't, then add a tutorial after a lecture to help them out. This makes teaching the core concepts easier without having to "fix it" to work with the cool features.

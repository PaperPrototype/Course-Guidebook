# Intro
Workflow methods to create excellent courses. (We center everything around making high quality courses)

## Put yourself as the student
Problem:
When taking a course it is often frustrating when a teacher forgets to mention that *little piece of code* that was changed or added.

Solution/Implementation:
To solve this when making a project for a tutorial/course first make a test version of the project. Then when writing the lecture re-write the entire project with the student as you teach them how to make it.

Why:
This will help prevent you from forgetting to mention "that little piece of code". And believe me, it has helped me find many mistakes in lectures, especially forgetting to explain some critical code changes or a function that was added.

You might also change the code a bit and simplify it for the student, I find tht this happens a lot albeit with small changes. Also often when explaining the code to a student as you write the code yourself will help you find bugs and imporovements that you can do. Once I actually removed a complex rounding function because I realised it was completely uneccessary.


# Stop and help students
Solution:
When working on a course if you get a request for help from a student it is a good idea to pause and help them. Obviously if your getting tons of requests for help from students then you won't be able tot get work done. <-- (Problem:) This is a good warning that lots of students are getting stuck and the course they are taking needs improved!

Why:
So even if you don't get work done on your current course, you should pause and make sure to improve the courses students are getting stuck on.

This will help make sure that all courses are constantly being maintained and kept up to date, as well as constantly improving the courses.

Making really high quality courses is even more important than making lots of courses, because, say you made tons of courses all the time but they all had errors and sucked then you've just wasted a whole lot of time (yours and the students).


## For a seamless student experience
I've found that the best way to learn what students are getting stuck on in your course, is to sit down with a student as they take the course and have them ask you for help when they get stuck. When they do ask you for help, once you finish explaining or helping them, write down their question. Then later you can go back and edit the course to make sure other students don't get stuck. You will also be able to clarify things a lot, and you will notice many errors.

You can try to edit the course as you help them. But you rtest student may get annoyed. So I found that just helping them as they need it, then writing a note for myself on paper, was much better.

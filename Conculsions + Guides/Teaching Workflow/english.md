# Intro
Workflow methods to create excellent courses. (We center everything around making high quality courses)

## For a seamless student experience
Problem:
When taking a course it is often frustrating when a teacher forgets to mention that *little piece of code* that was changed. 

Solution/Implementation:
To solve this when making a project for a tutorial/course first make a test version of the project. Then when writing the lecture wirte the code for the final version of the project as you write the lecture. 

Why:
This forces you to go through the same experience the student will when writing the code for the project and will make sure you don't accidentally forget to mention "that little piece of code".

# Stop and help students to improve other courses
Solution:
When working on a course if you get a request for help from a student it is a good idea to pause and help them. Obviously if your getting tons of requests for help from students then you won't be able tot get work done. <-- (Problem:) This is a good warning that lots of students are getting stuck and the course they are taking needs improved!

Why:
So even if you don't get work done on your current course, you should pause and make sure to improve the courses students are getting stuck on. And making really high quality courses is even more important than making lots of courses because if you make tons of courses and they all suck then you've just wasted a whole lot of time (Yours and the students).

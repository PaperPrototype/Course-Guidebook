This document aims to prove using first principles reasoning all the guidelines presented in the other documents in this repo.

We want to prove these teaching methods to for once for all have a teaching method that makes sure no student is left scratching their heads, and, that every student becomes self motivated and not bored.

This document is an open debate to rigorously find the first principles behind human learning and motivation.

To accomplish this we will break down every method until all that is left is a first or some principle(s).

first prinicples were used to solve quantum physics. THis is because oncwe you break something down to its most fundamental parts you finding things that are sometimes counter intuitive. First principle sis the best way to think about new ideas, because we don't have to rely on experience to know if something will work or not, we can just use first principles to figure it out. This is what Elon Musk does and others like him have done, sadly first principles reasoning has not quite reached the general audience. Most people think in terms of anologies to fiqure things out, but anlogy thinking requires experience. So with first principles we can learn about things no one has ever experienced, and thus figure out how to make future technology.

Once we figure out the first principle we can make build useful principles on top of them that can be used to form teaching methods and guidelines.


# How to find first principles and what is a first principle?
(TODO improve, more pragmatic, more useful, more CORRECT)

A note: Most of this is a guess so this document needs corrected by someone who actaully knows what first principles reasoning is. This document needs significantly improved and re-written

If I say "man is mortal" then if you ask "Why is man mortal?" you get "Because men die". Then ask "Why do men die?" and so on and so forth until you reach a statement that you can't answer the why to "Because we age" and if you ask why to that you get "Because things that age die" and then ask "why do things that age die" and so on and so forth. The final answer that would eventualy be something so fundamental that "why" cannot be asked, and that answer would be a first principle.

EDIT:
by always asking WHY, we can eventually find a first principle aka a funcdamental concept, that relies on no other concept for its existence

# First principles... Sorta

#### 1
[A reason for everything]
When we do something it has an effect wether we know it or not whether good or bad.

#### 2
[Everything is gradual]
The only true constant in existance is change.

#### 3
[Simple things are more easily understood]

#### 3.1
    [Simple things adopt quickly]

#### 3.2
    [Simple things are learned by many]

#### 4
[The more solid the concept (aka taught through a solid example), the easier the concept is understood]
A beginner will more easily

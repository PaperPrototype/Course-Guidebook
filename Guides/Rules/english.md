# Rules
this isn't mean't to be a restrictive rules codument, instead mostly obvious rules that some people might not follow.

## OMG_RULE_001
**KEEP IT CLEAN**
Rule number one. No pornagraphic content or sexually suggestive content of any kind whatsoever.

## OMG_RULE_002
**NO FOUL LANGUAGE**
No curse words or foul language. No swearing or using astericks in place of certain letters of a swear word. There is a word for what you are trying to say. Using a curse word for the decrtipion of everything makes what you are saying highly un-informative. For example "the cat was *** cool" (I know I broke the rule "using astericks in place of certain letters", breaking the rule in order to explain it deserves a break). The sentence doesn't really portray what the cat did that was cool! "the cat flipped like a ninja and grabbed the sword in the air" is waaaay more descriptive.

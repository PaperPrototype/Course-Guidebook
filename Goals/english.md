# Goal
If we could just download all the information from experts into other peoples minds, suddenly you would have lots of awesome tech being made instead of hordes of beginners trying to "figure it out". I want to get the masses to be able to have the knowledge to blow away the world and build a future of mind blowing tech, that anyone can understand and make.

If you find it annoying that people are always struggling and asking you questions about how to do something, if there was a really good course on it then you could just point them to it knowing theat they will be able to go on and follow a path of courses and become an expert if they want. And Viola! A whole generation of really well educated devs that are experts!

My goal is to replace college ed with online courses that are way better than the courses you can take in college, and create a whole bunch of really knowledgable and capable engine developers / game devs and as a result have exciting tech being made.

But first we need to get beginners to become experts, experts that can make entire game engines and bleeding edge tech. Then those experts will go on to make the future. I find this much more promising and guaranteeing than tryiing to make the future ourselves.

We will do this by forcing every course to have the proper pre-requisites all the way down to "Intro to Coding". This way there are no "gaps" or bridges of knowledge for the students, we want them to be unstoppable. We will acheive the goal eventually, and we're not giving up. Ever. Humaniity is going to make it to mars, and our students are going to make Ready Player 1.

These guidelines are a result of trying to achieve this by coming up a with a teaching method that will remove the problems current education systems have.

(Please feel free to add to this list so that we can improve this document)
 - lack of motivation
 - boredom
 - not understanding the material
 - frustration from incorrect material or lack of guidance
 - students not knowing why they are learning something so their mind doesn't care to remember it
 - most students don't want to do the "excercises", or just don't do them because the didn't understand the material and the excersices are stressful

    Motivation drives intelligence. If we bore a student to death they won't want to learn. To paraphrase Elon Musk "If you don't know why you are are learning something, your mind gets rid of the information because it doeson't need it." And I think this is why students will find a subject boring.

The goal of these methods is to try to make education addictive and use the natural human instinct to drive a students curiosity to the point they end up taking that course because they just can't help it. 

One method to solve the curiosity and motivation is to make a super awesome voxel tech video that inspires the student so they want to make something like it and then making a frustration-free well explained course, that will make the student an expert on the topic, on how to make that very same voxel tech.

Throughout history whenever the general knowledge was increased that is when we saw advancements in technology.

# Achieving the goal
With first principles we can prove and fiqure things out without ever having to "experience" them to gain knowledge of them. 

With first principles we can achive making a teachig method that can achieve the goals (we layout pragmatic (practical / useful) conclusions in the "conclusions" section), unless we find that there is a fundamental principle that prevents us from achiving our goal. In thagt case we will find a way to come close to achieving a perfection of teaching methods.


TODO move below into conclusions
# Principles
Don't force teachers to teach or structure their courses in a certain way. Instead provide really good resources on how and why we recommend a certain way of teaching.

Why:
This will result in us learning about our erronous teaching methods and prevent us from forcing people to teach, or do things (in general), in a way that is not actually good or benefitial.

We've discovered a Fundamental truth:
If you prove everything and never force poeple to do things your way you will end up perfecting, and correcting, your way and people will want to do things your way.

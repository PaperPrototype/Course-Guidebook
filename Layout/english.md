# Course Types
We separate courses into 2 types, one being an intro course covering the most generic basics, then outro courses cover the specifics of applying the generic knowledge to a specific project. This makes the courses smaller and more modular, while being WAY less boring, and able to adapt to any students learning desires.


### (Intro) Knowledge Course
A knowledge course should be designed to teach a student concepts and then let them explore those concepts in their own projects, or trhough optional tutorials. These courses should not be made of one large project, instead they should use the smallest and simplest "micro projcts" that each teaches new concept(s). This ensures the concepts you need to teach don't have to become specialized or bogged down by the specifics of the "cool project" you are doing.


### (Outro) Tutorial Course
A tutorial course should teach the student how to make a large cool project like making a specific popular renderer, or making an AI physics system. These courses will inevitably have to teach some concepts, but currently it seems, that it would be better if these courses were to come after a knowledge course and simply apply what the student already knows and show them how to use it to make, for example, a planet using what they learned from an intro voxel systems course. As such, Tutorial courses must always have a pre-requisite knowledge course, or, another Tutorials course.


# Layout
Knowlwdge courses should only teach the core. This makes them shorter and prevents having monolithic courses. This happened with [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). 

To solve this we create intro (or Knowledge) courses, that only teaches the core and simple stuff, nothing fancy, with side tutorials after each lecture to keep the student entertained with the knowledge they've learned, and satisfy their natural want for applying their newly aquired skill to some cool project (like making a small planet using voxels).

Then after the intro courses we can have outro (or Tutorial) courses, that, take the knowledge of the student and apply it to a very specific project. This way students don't get bored by a course that tries to teach "everything" because most of the time a student is interested in a specific thing, that they will use for their own project.

We make sure to teach the student the more complex stuff and all the specifics in the TUtorial courses. We are able to keep their attention because they are making an awesome project, and they already know all the basics, so we can get straight to the complex and specifics and get them over with relatively quickly. This also allows many, many, outro or Tutorial courses to be made after an intro course, giving lots of possibilities to the teacher. Whereas if we just made one monolithic generic course, you have to cut away and try and reach a larger audience, making the course longer and more boring for the students.

This keeps the intro (aka knolwedge) courses fresh, small, and easily finishable. Which sadly is **not** how THe Rust Book stayed.

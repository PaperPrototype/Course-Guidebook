This document aims to prove using first principles reasoning all the guidelines presented in the other documents in this repo.

We want to prove these teaching methods to for once for all have a teaching method that makes sure no student is left scratching their heads, and, that every student becomes self motivated and not bored.

This document is an open debate to rigorously find the first principles behind human learning and motivation.

To accomplish this we will break down every method until all that is left is a first or some principle(s).

first prinicples were used to solve quantum physics. THis is because oncwe you break something down to its most fundamental parts you finding things that are sometimes counter intuitive. First principle sis the best way to think about new ideas, because we don't have to rely on experience to know if something will work or not, we can just use first principles to figure it out. This is what Elon Musk does and others like him have done, sadly first principles reasoning has not quite reached the general audience. Most people think in terms of anologies to fiqure things out, but anlogy thinking requires experience. So with first principles we can find ou things about stuff no one has experienced, and fiqure out future technology.

# How to find first principles and what is a first principle
If I say "man is mortal" then if you ask "Why is man mortal?" you get "Because men die". Then ask "Why do men die?" and so on and so forth until you reach a statement that you can't answer the why to "Because we age" and if you ask why to that you get "Because things that age die" and then ask "why do things that age die" and so on and so forth. The final answer that would eventualy be something so fundamental that "why" cannot be asked, and that answer would be a first principle.


# Arguments
Teach things in context of their application.

Explain why something is useful and why you are learning it.

Give an example first, then define what the concept is.
proofs:
- If we explain what a concept is first the student will not understand it and just hear a technical explaination that might make sense once an example is given.
